The Transcription Start Site of each gene can be classified according to the nucleosomes surrounding it.
For each gene and within a window of 300 bp. both upstream and downstream, a +1 nucleosome is searched downstream of the TSS and a -1 nucleosome is searched upstream of the TSS. These two nucleosomes can be either well-positioned (shortened as W) or fuzzy (shortened as F) or can be missing.

Additionally, these two nucleosomes' dyads can be close together or further apart. If they are closer than 215 bp., we call it a close conformation, otherwise, we call it an open conformation.

Taking all this information into account, a transcription start site can present any of the following conformations: W-close-W, W-close-F, F-close-W, F-close-F, W-open-W, W-open-F, F-open-W, F-open-F, +1 missing, W - missing, F - missing
